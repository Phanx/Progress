Progress
===========

Progress displays your experience and reputation in a simple format on
any DataBroker display.

If you are below the maximum level, Progress will show your experience.
If you are at the maximum level, Progress will show your reputation with
your currently watched faction. More detailed information is shown in
the tooltip.

Click the plugin to open the Blizzard reputation panel.

There are no options. In the future, options may be added to customize
the plugin text, as well as to show reputation in the tooltip even for
characters below the maximum level.
