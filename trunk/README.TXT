Description

	Progress is a DataBroker plugin that simply displays your current
	location. It does not have coordinates, level ranges, recommended
	dungeons, or any other frills. It is intended to replace the minimap
	location bar, and nothing more.

Usage

	Progress has no in-game configuration. A few options are available
	through Lua editing, in the Progress.lua file.

	Compatible with: en*, deDE, esES, esMX, frFR, koKR, ruRU, zhCN, zhTW
